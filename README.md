# City-Segmentation-feat.-Foursquare-Geolocation-API
The aim of this project is to help tourists choose their decisions about where to stay and what kind of experiences they would like to have in each neighbourhood in L.A. This also helps people and stakeholders make informed decisions related to city of Los Angeles & Toronto
We will require geolocation data of Los Angeles & Toronto city. We can find out the neighbourhoods, venues and their most popular venue categories by scraping some data from wikipedia 
* [L.A. Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_districts_and_neighborhoods_in_Los_Angeles)
* [Toronto Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighbourhoods_in_Toronto)
